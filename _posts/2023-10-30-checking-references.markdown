Over the years, I have done many reference checks as part of the YCharts engineering interview process, and I have been called by others who are doing a reference check on someone I worked with or managed. 

I haven't seen many people write about them, so I thought I would share my thoughts on them. Not all interview processes check references. I think it is a good practice, but I understand why some companies don't do it.  

### Normal reference checks can be useless
You are usually talking to someone that a candidate has given you and prepped to say nice things about them. In addition, a person you are calling is human and may have a relationship with the candidate that they don't want to betray. If you have ever been asked to give a reference, you probably would feel guilty if you said anything that would jeopardize their shot at the job! 

Incentives are not always aligned here for the person responding to a reference check supplied by the candidate. I have always thought of it as my job to try to get the reference to say something of substance without feeling guilty about the person.

### Favorite two reference questions to ask

> If you were going to pair ____ with someone on a project, what type of person would you pair them with and why?

> If I called you in 6 months and told you that it didnâ€™t work out, what would you assume was the reason?

A little wordy, sure. Can you come up with a better way to phrase them? I am sure you can. You get the gist, though. 

The questions force the person in the end to really answer the question many people ask: "What are the candidate's strengths and weaknesses?" No one has ever honestly told me someone's weaknesses when I ask them directly; however, with this, they are indirectly telling you what this person could be lacking without feeling guilty.

You might hear someone say: "They are really productive but sometimes have a hard time organizing all of their work, so I would pair them with someone who is pretty organized and detail-oriented." In that one sentence, you can learn a lot about the person.
