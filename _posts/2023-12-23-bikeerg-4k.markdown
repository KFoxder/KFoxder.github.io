Over the last 3 months I have been working with my good friend [Jesse Biddle](https://www.instagram.com/boymeetserg/) on a BikeErg 4000m training plan. After missing the first round of the [2023 ErgWars competition](https://comp.erg.zone/leaderboard/lkFaVlspSE2cjo_K1Fo_Ag?genders=M&utm_source=ergzone) and coming in 27th in the male division I wanted to test out the 4k time trial.

Result: I beat my previous 4K time by about 8 seconds.

We will probably test this again in Dec 2024 and see if I can improve it.
